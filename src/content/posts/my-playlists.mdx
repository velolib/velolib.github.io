In this blog post, I'll go over some of my public playlists on Spotify. I'll talk about the inspiration behind them, the songs I've added, and the general vibe of each playlist.

# Everything I Know About Laufey

Laufey has been my #1 artist on Spotify from 2023 to 2024. I discovered her
music from when I was printing an assignment and my mom was playing music on
shuffle on her Mac. I heard "Beautiful Stranger" and was instantly hooked.

This playlist is just all of my liked Laufey songs, and the name is a play on one of her albums, "Everything I Know About Love".
My favorite song from this playlist is clearly "Beautiful Stranger", because it's the song that got me into her music.

# Kero Kero Bonito

Unlike the previous playlist, this one isn't specially named. Though, you may
notice the playlist cover is not just the covers of the albums. Kero Kero Bonito
is a band that I discovered from YouTube, and I've been listening to them ever
since.

This playlist is a mix of all of my liked KKB songs, basically their best songs from
all 3 of their albums. One thing I like about their discography is that all 3 of their albums
are very different from each other, but they still have that KKB vibe. My favorite song from this playlist is "The Princess and the Clock".

# (Unicode Piano)

This playlist is a bit different from the previous ones. It's a playlist of
mostly instrumental songs that have the piano as the main instrument. I named it
"█▄█▄██▄█▄█▄█" because it's a bunch of Unicode characters that look like a
piano.

You might think that this playlist only contains classical music, but it's actually mostly contemporary music.
I like to listen to this playlist when I'm studying or working, because it's very calming and helps me focus.
My favorite song from this playlist is "Exhale" by Lena Raine.

# Games

Not the most interesting playlist, but it's a playlist of all of the songs from
video games that I like. It's chronological, so the first songs are from the
games I played when I was a kid, and the last songs are from the games I played
recently.

My favorite song from this playlist is "Farewell" by Lena Raine. It's from the game Celeste, which is one of my favorite games of all time.

# Read Only Memories

This playlist is a collection of my 100 favorite mostly instrumental mostly
electronic songs. I named it "Read Only Memories" from the name of Daft Punk's
album, because I think it fits the vibe of the playlist.

This playlist features more well-known electronic music artists such as Camellia, Snail's House, meganeko, and more.
Right now my favorite song from this playlist is "starlight speedway" by floopy, but sometimes when I listen
to this playlist I like to reorder the songs. Did I mention this playlist is ordered by how much I like the songs?
