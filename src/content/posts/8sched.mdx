Check out my latest project: [8sched.pages.dev](https://8sched.pages.dev/)

It's a website where everyone in my grade can check their schedule for each day of the week.
Each time block is separated into their own piece and time blocks that are the same are combined so that it's easier to parse.

Right now, the data is manually inputted from me by updating the `.csv` file in the repository.
In the future, I want to integrate this with the Google Sheets API so that I (and maybe someone else in the future) will be able to maintain this project more easily.

That's all. Thanks for reading.
